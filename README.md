# Dyson Sphere Planner

Recipe browser, potentially planner at some point. You could call it early access ;)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

Note that you'll need to grab and transform game data for this app to run. I am currently not uploading it on purpose since I am not 100% clear what the devs would have to say about that.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but give me a few days to clean up this mess that I rushed out.
